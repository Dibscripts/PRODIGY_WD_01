# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project demonstrates a modern, interactive navigation menu using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page, changes style when you scroll, and features smooth hover effects on menu items.

## Features

- **Scroll Effect:** The navbar changes background and text color when you scroll down.
- **Hover Effect:** Menu items highlight with a color change on hover.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks good on all screen sizes.
- **Modern Styling:** Uses gradients and smooth transitions for a polished look.
